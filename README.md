This repository contains all the materials presented at the FSL 23' (Feira do Software Livre). At this event [Jorge Catarino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jp-catarino/) and I spoke on the topic "Building a Custom OS - Introduction to Yocto Project".

## Presentation
The presentation slides are available [here](fsl23-slides.pdf). The presentation is divided into two parts:

### Part 1

## Instructions
The second part of the presentation is a hands-on session where we'll be building a custom Linux distribution using Yocto Project. You can use the Google Colab notebook available [online](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CHOb7vM43-02BuIe7xaQJsu9VwpvCl8L?usp=sharing) or using the [local](fsl23-guide.ipynb) version.
